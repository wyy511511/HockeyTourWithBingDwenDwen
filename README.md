# HockeyTourWithBingDwenDwen
## Intro
HockeyTourWithBingDwenDwen used three technologies, ARKit, ARQuickLook and SwiftUI, to introduce hockey.

I use ARKit and ARQuickLook to show the 3D models of the hockey rink and Bing Dwen Dwen. ARQuickLook makes it very easy to zoom in and out of the models.This allows the user to look closely and understand the structure of the hockey rink and imagine that they are visiting it.
Children may enjoy taking pictures with BingDwenDwen using ARQuickLook.

I use SwiftUI to present some of the details of the hockey offside process and so on. SwiftUI's responsive programming and elegant animations are perfect for show some of the processes involved in hockey.
